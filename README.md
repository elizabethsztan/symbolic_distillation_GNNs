## Symbolic Distillation of GNNs

Recreating the main results of the paper [Discovering Symbolic Models from Deep Learning with Inductive Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11287). 

Please see my [personal GitHub page](https://github.com/elizabethsztan/symbolic_distillation_GNNs) for the most up to date progress on this project. I am doing the project there right now to make my GitHub all green! I'll sync that repo here later on!
